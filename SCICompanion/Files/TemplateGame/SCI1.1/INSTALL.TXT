\\bootIntro
This procedure creates a floppy disk you can use to boot your computer to \
ensure that enough conventional memory is available to run this game.

This procedure will read your current configuration, which may involve \
searching your hard disk to find needed files.  Then it will format a floppy \
disk in drive A:, and create appropriate AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files on \
the floppy disk.

Not all systems support this procedure, but trying it can do no harm.
\\bootSuccess

Please label the disk in drive %c: "Sierra Boot Disk".

press the Control, Alt and Del keys simultaneously to reboot your computer.
